I'm really trying!

# Open Data Science
The course is about open data science, with a special emphasis on R, and RStudio in particular. It's a powerful tool to 
1. analyze data
2. create plots to show your results
3. create content in html-format and many others
4. and much more

# github
Every student in the course needs to create a github account to share their assignments.
