*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

# Open Data Course
This is a course to get started on _Open Data Science_, an issue very much pushed by the University of Helsinki. I'm particularly interested in learning to use R for analyzing my research data that I will collect in the course of my PhD.

## Assignments
It seems like there's going to be a lot of work to be done throughout the course but I guess that's the only way to really learn how to use all the tools. **No pain, no gain!**

The assignments include:

1. Datacamp exercises
2. R exercises
3. github
    + uploading your exercises
    + providing a link to the repository
